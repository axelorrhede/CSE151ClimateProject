        "\n",
        "This is the core model wrapper built with **PyTorch Lightning**, which organizes the training, validation, and testing logic for the climate emulation task. Lightning abstracts away much of the boilerplate code in PyTorch-based deep learning workflows, making it easier to scale models.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **`training_step` / `validation_step` / `test_step`**: Standard Lightning hooks for computing loss and predictions at each stage. The loss used is **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Normalization-aware outputs**:\n",
        "  - During validation and testing, predictions and targets are denormalized before evaluation using stored mean/std statistics.\n",
        "  - This ensures evaluation is done in real-world units (Kelvin and mm/day).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Metric Evaluation** via `_evaluate()`:\n",
        "  For each variable (`tas`, `pr`), it calculates:\n",
        "  - **Monthly Area-Weighted RMSE**\n",
        "  - **Time-Mean RMSE** (RMSE on 10-year average's)\n",
        "  - **Time-Stddev MAE** (MAE on 10-year standard deviation; a measure of temporal variability)\n",
        "    \n",
        "  These metrics reflect the competition's evaluation criteria and are logged and printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Kaggle Submission Writer**:\n",
        "  After testing, predictions are saved to a `.csv` file in the required Kaggle format via `_save_submission()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Saving Predictions for Visualization**:\n",
        "  - Validation predictions are saved tao `val_preds.npy` and `val_trues.npy`\n",
        "  - These can be loaded later for visual inspection of the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        " 🔧 **Feel free to modify any part of this module** (loss functions, evaluation, training logic) to better suit your model or training pipeline / Use pure PyTorch etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ The **final submission `.csv` file must strictly follow the format and naming convention used in `_save_submission()`**, as these `ID`s are used to match predictions to the hidden test set during evaluation.\n",
